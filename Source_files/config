##Path to project directory
projectDir=path/to/project_directory

##Path to raw_data directory. This directory should have subdirectory with sample name containing fastq files
raw_data_dir=path/to/raw/project_directory/raw_data_directory

##Result directory: Result from each of the functions (fastqc,trimming, alignment, feature count , etc)
## will be hold in independent directory inside result directory
result_dir==path/to/raw/project_directory/results

#Sequencing is PE (Paied end) or SE(single end)
type=PE

#Path to GTF file, Only if you are executing feature count function.
path_to_GTF=

#Path to genome index file for mapping merge
genomeDir=

#Path to the kadi directory
KadiRun=



#number of CPU (8-16)
CPU=8

## COMMANDS To EXECUTE ##
# IF ANY STEP IS NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN ANANLYSIS, SET THAT CMD VARIABLE TO 'PASS'.
#e.g if trimming of reads has to be avoided then set CMD3 to PASS as CMD3=PASS

# mergefiles of raw fastq files
CMD1=merge_raw_reads
# Fastqc of raw reads
CMD2=fastqcb4
# Trim reads
#OPTIONS are cutadapt, sickle, trimommatic
CMD3=sickle
# Fastqc of processed reads
CMD4=fastqc_after_trim./fastqc_after_trim
#Mapping to reference genome/transcriptome
#OPTIONS: Bowtie1, Bowtie2, STAR, BWA, HiSAT, TopHat
CMD5=STAR
#Aligned file format
# OPTIONS: BAM or SAM (will be sorted by coordinate)
CMD6=BAM
#Feature count
#OPTIONS: htseq_count, express, RSEM, featurecounts,
CMD7=htseq_count
####Differential_expression
######OPTIONS: CuffDiff, DESeq2, EdgeR, Gfold, Noiseq
######CMD8=DESeq2
